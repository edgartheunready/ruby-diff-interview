# ruby-diff

A simple test of ruby knowledge

## Objective
There are two files.  These two files contain strings.  Write a ruby script
to take the contents of file1 and compares them to the contents of file2.
Print the files lines that appear in file1 but do not appear in file2.

## Submission
Fork this repo, craft your solution, and submit a pull request when you're
finished.

## Hints and other information
* The line number on which a given string is irrelevant
* comparison should be case sensitive
* it is merely a coincidence that each file contains 1000 lines.
* Bonus points if your code is written in a reusable fashion.
* Bonus points if your code has tests.
